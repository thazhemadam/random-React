# random-react
random-react is a repository that consists of a few small applications that were built whilst getting some experience with React.<br/>
These applications are hence not to be expected to have much significance or purpose on their own.
## Toggle
Toggle can be used to toggle the visibility of a HTML element.
## Counter
Counter, as the name suggests, can be used as a counter. Starting from 0 (or any number you want, if you tinker with the source code accordingly), the user can increment/decrement the counter's value by one, or reset the counter entirely, back to its initially state (presently 0).
## Portfolio 
Portfolio can be used for displaying details about an individual's portfolio (a dashboard, portfolio items, and contact details).
